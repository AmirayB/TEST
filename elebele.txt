Here's a text you can use:

Hey there! How's your day going? Just wanted to say hi and see if you're up for [activity suggestion, e.g., grabbing coffee, watching a movie, going for a walk]. Let me know what you think!

Or, if you'd like something more specific, let me know the context and I can tailor a text for you.

For example, if you want to send a text to a friend who's feeling down, you might say:

Hey, I know things have been tough lately. Just wanted to let you know I'm here for you, and you're not alone. Want to chat or do something to take your mind off things?

Need more options? Let me know!
